well hello people , reading this readme !
this is just a fun thing i thought of applying by learning the document.getElementById() in javascript 
i had a idea of how we make this into a situation where the car is broken down , then it gets fixed by users response through buttons . 
i managed to get idea of the javascript code , hope i can apply this in bigger elemennts , yeeeeeeee!!!!

~Happy to Help , and see you in next fun outburst of my ideas !
